You are an expert in Knowledge graph and Knowledge graph Evaluation.

Task: There is a metric called PRISM which stands for Personalized Relevance weighted information score metric. This metric is responsible for providing the condition of a knowledge graph and uses the class instantiation ratio, property instantiation ratio for getting the structrure related information. Timeliness for consideting the staleness of the data and subgraph importance for getting the information about how much the subgraph rooted at its parent class is being queried by external clients. All these metrics are calculated on a knowledge graph which represented as a RDF graph. Expand on this idea and provide sample table which makes sense of the inferences

===================================

Okay, let's expand on the concept of the PRISM (Personalized Relevance weighted Information Score Metric) for evaluating Knowledge Graph (KG) condition, particularly within the context of RDF graphs.

**PRISM: Personalized Relevance Weighted Information Score Metric**

**Concept:**

PRISM aims to provide a holistic score representing the "health" or "condition" of a Knowledge Graph, specifically tailored to its perceived utility for its consumers (hence "Personalized Relevance"). It acknowledges that a KG's value isn't just about how much data it holds, but also about its structural integrity, data freshness, and how relevant its different parts are to actual usage patterns.

It decomposes the KG condition into three primary dimensions:

1.  **Structural Soundness (S):** How well-formed and well-populated is the graph according to its schema?
2.  **Timeliness (T):** How up-to-date is the information within the graph?
3.  **Subgraph Importance (SI):** How relevant or frequently utilized are specific parts (subgraphs) of the KG?

These dimensions are combined using weights, which can be adjusted based on the priorities of the KG application or stakeholders (the "Personalization" aspect).

**Components Breakdown (in RDF Context):**

1.  **Structural Soundness (S):** This assesses the instantiation quality. In an RDF graph represented by triples (`subject`, `predicate`, `object`), this involves:
    *   **Class Instantiation Ratio (CIR):**
        *   **Measures:** The proportion of defined classes (`rdfs:Class` or `owl:Class`) in the schema that have at least one instance (`rdf:type`) declared in the graph.
        *   **Why:** A low CIR might indicate that many concepts defined in the ontology are theoretical but not actually represented by data points, suggesting potential schema bloat or incomplete data acquisition.
        *   **Calculation Idea:** `CIR = (Number of Classes C where EXISTS instance 'i' such that <i, rdf:type, C>) / (Total number of Classes defined in the schema)`
    *   **Property Instantiation Ratio (PIR):**
        *   **Measures:** The extent to which defined properties (`rdf:Property`, `owl:ObjectProperty`, `owl:DatatypeProperty`) are used. This can be nuanced. A simple version might measure the proportion of defined properties that are used in at least one triple. A more sophisticated version could assess, for instances of a given class, the average completeness concerning the properties defined in its domain.
        *   **Why:** Low PIR might indicate unused properties in the schema or data that consistently lacks certain attributes. High PIR suggests the defined predicates are actively used to describe entities.
        *   **Calculation Idea (per class average completeness):** For a Class `C`, `PIR(C) = Average over instances 'i' of C [ (Number of distinct properties 'p' where <i, p, o> exists AND domain(p)=C) / (Total number of properties 'p' defined with domain(p)=C) ]`. The overall PIR could be an average over key classes or a global measure.
    *   **Combining:** The overall Structure score `S` could be a weighted average: `S = w_cir * CIR + w_pir * PIR`.

2.  **Timeliness (T):**
    *   **Measures:** The freshness of the data. This requires metadata about when triples or entities were added or last verified/updated. This might involve looking at graph timestamps, triple-level provenance/timestamps (e.g., using RDF* or named graphs with associated metadata).
    *   **Why:** Stale data can be misleading or useless, especially for dynamic domains. High timeliness indicates the KG reflects the current state of the represented world.
    *   **Calculation Idea:** Could be the proportion of entities/triples updated within a specific recent timeframe (e.g., last 30 days), or the average age of information, normalized. `T = (Number of entities/triples updated within threshold T_recent) / (Total relevant entities/triples)`. The definition of "relevant" and `T_recent` depends on the domain.

3.  **Subgraph Importance (SI):**
    *   **Measures:** The relevance or utility of different parts of the KG, often defined as subgraphs rooted at specific parent classes (e.g., the subgraph containing all `Person` instances and their properties, or all `Product` instances). Importance is typically derived from external signals, primarily query logs.
    *   **Why:** Not all parts of a large KG are equally important to its users. Focusing evaluation and improvement efforts on frequently accessed or critical subgraphs yields a better return on investment. This directly incorporates the "Personalized Relevance" aspect.
    *   **Calculation Idea:** Analyze query logs to count how often entities or properties belonging to a specific subgraph (defined by class membership, e.g., all instances of `Class C` and their immediate properties) are accessed. `SI(C) = (Number of queries accessing Subgraph C) / (Total number of queries)`, possibly normalized or scaled logarithmically.

**Calculating the Overall PRISM Score:**

The PRISM score is calculated as a weighted sum of the component scores, typically for a specific subgraph `G_c` rooted at a class `C` or for the entire graph `G`.

`PRISM(G_c) = w_s * S(G_c) + w_t * T(G_c) + w_si * SI(C)`

Where:
*   `S(G_c)` is the Structure score calculated over the subgraph `G_c`.
*   `T(G_c)` is the Timeliness score calculated over the subgraph `G_c`.
*   `SI(C)` is the Importance score for the subgraph associated with class `C`.
*   `w_s`, `w_t`, `w_si` are weights reflecting the relative importance of Structure, Timeliness, and Subgraph Importance, respectively (e.g., `w_s + w_t + w_si = 1`). These weights can be customized. For instance, an application requiring real-time data might assign a higher `w_t`, while an archival application might prioritize `w_s`.

**Sample Table Illustrating PRISM Scores for Different Subgraphs**

Let's assume a hypothetical KG about a company, its products, employees, and news mentions. We calculate PRISM scores for subgraphs rooted at key classes.

**Assumptions for the Table:**
*   Scores (CIR, PIR, S, T, SI, PRISM) are normalized to a scale of 0 (worst) to 1 (best).
*   Structure Score `S = 0.5 * CIR + 0.5 * PIR`.
*   Default Weights for PRISM: `w_s = 0.3`, `w_t = 0.4`, `w_si = 0.3`.

| Root Class (Subgraph) | CIR   | PIR   | Structure (S) (0.5*CIR + 0.5*PIR) | Timeliness (T) (Prop. updated < 1 month) | Subgraph Importance (SI) (Normalized Query Freq.) | PRISM Score (0.3*S + 0.4*T + 0.3*SI) | Interpretation / Potential Action                                                                                                |
| :-------------------- | :---- | :---- | :-------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ex:Employee`         | 0.95  | 0.85  | 0.90                              | 0.60                                       | 0.75                                            | 0.735                                | **Good Condition.** Structure is strong, relevance is high. Timeliness is decent but could be improved (e.g., faster updates on role changes). |
| `ex:Product`          | 0.90  | 0.70  | 0.80                              | 0.85                                       | 0.95                                            | 0.865                                | **Very Good Condition, High Priority.** Highly relevant and timely. Structure is good, but PIR suggests some product attributes might be missing. Focus on completing product descriptions. |
| `ex:SalesDeal`        | 0.75  | 0.90  | 0.83                              | 0.95                                       | 0.60                                            | 0.809                                | **Good Condition.** Very timely and well-structured where present. CIR suggests some deal types might not be instantiated yet. Importance is moderate. |
| `ex:NewsArticle`      | 1.00  | 0.95  | 0.98                              | 0.90                                       | 0.40                                            | 0.774                                | **Structurally Excellent, Moderately Relevant.** Data is well-formed and timely. Lower importance score suggests less direct querying; maybe used more for background context. Maintain current quality. |
| `ex:Competitor`       | 0.60  | 0.50  | 0.55                              | 0.30                                       | 0.50                                            | 0.435                                | **Needs Attention.** Structure is weak (low CIR/PIR), data is relatively stale, moderate relevance. Action: Improve data acquisition/validation for competitors; review schema relevance. |
| `ex:HistoricalEvent`  | 0.90  | 0.80  | 0.85                              | 0.05                                       | 0.10                                            | 0.305                                | **Low Priority/Acceptable?** Structurally sound but data is inherently old (low T) and rarely queried (low SI). Low PRISM reflects low dynamic value. Acceptable if archival is the goal. |

**Inferences and Benefits from the Table:**

1.  **Prioritization:** The PRISM score immediately highlights which parts of the KG are in the best condition (`ex:Product`) and which need the most attention (`ex:Competitor`). The `ex:HistoricalEvent` has a low score, but the interpretation clarifies this might be acceptable given its nature.
2.  **Diagnostic:** Looking at the component scores (S, T, SI) for a low-PRISM subgraph reveals *why* it's scoring poorly. `ex:Competitor` suffers from both weak structure and poor timeliness.
3.  **Actionable Insights:** The interpretation suggests concrete actions, like improving data completeness for `ex:Product` or enhancing data acquisition for `ex:Competitor`.
4.  **Personalization Illustrated:** If a team focused purely on competitive intelligence used this KG, they might increase `w_si` and `w_t` for their calculations. This would further lower the PRISM score for `ex:Competitor`, emphasizing its inadequacy *for their specific needs*, even if its structure score (`S`) was higher. Conversely, a historical research team might prioritize `w_s` and deprioritize `w_t`, making the `ex:HistoricalEvent` subgraph appear more valuable in their personalized score.

In summary, PRISM provides a flexible and informative framework for KG evaluation by combining structural integrity, data freshness, and usage-based relevance, allowing for a nuanced understanding of the KG's overall condition and utility.

===========================================================
Version2: 
Okay, let's break down this multi-faceted approach to determining node and edge importance in a Knowledge Graph (KG). This is a sophisticated method because it moves beyond simple graph centrality measures and incorporates aspects of data quality, relevance, and actual usage.

**Core Idea:**

The importance of a node (representing an entity or a class) or an edge (representing a property or relationship) isn't monolithic. It's a combination of factors reflecting its structural role, data integrity, timeliness, and utility to consumers. By combining these perspectives, we get a more holistic and actionable measure of importance.

**Expanding on the Factors:**

1.  **Class Instantiation Ratio (CIR) - Structural Significance (Classes):**
    *   **What it measures:** For a given class (e.g., `Person`, `Company`, `Product`), how many instances of this class exist in the KG relative to other classes or a theoretical maximum? A simple way is `Number of instances of Class C / Total number of instances in KG`.
    *   **Why it's important:** A class with a high CIR represents a significant portion of the KG's domain knowledge. It indicates a well-populated category, suggesting structural importance and potentially higher interest. Low CIR might indicate a niche concept, an emerging category, or incomplete data ingestion for that class.
    *   **Impact:** Primarily determines the importance of **Class nodes**. High CIR generally implies higher importance for the class itself.

2.  **Property Instantiation Ratio (PIR) - Structural Significance & Completeness (Properties/Edges & indirectly Instances):**
    *   **What it measures:** For a given property (edge type, e.g., `hasSpouse`, `locatedIn`, `producedBy`), how often is this property actually used compared to how often it *could* potentially be used (based on its domain and range definitions)? Or, more practically, its frequency relative to other properties. Can be measured as `Number of triples using Property P / Total number of triples` or `Number of triples using Property P / Number of instances in domain(P)`.
    *   **Why it's important:**
        *   **For Properties (Edges):** High PIR suggests the property represents a common, defining, or frequently captured relationship within the domain. It's structurally significant. Low PIR indicates a rarer, optional, or perhaps poorly captured relationship.
        *   **For Instances (Nodes):** While not directly PIR, we can assess an instance's "completeness" based on the PIR of properties *expected* for its class. An instance where many expected high-PIR properties are filled is likely more "complete" and potentially more important/useful than one with many missing common properties.
    *   **Impact:** Determines importance for **Property edges**. Indirectly informs the importance of **Instance nodes** via data completeness. High PIR for a property increases its importance.

3.  **Timeliness - Data Relevance & Staleness (Nodes & Edges):**
    *   **What it measures:** How up-to-date is the information represented by a node or edge? This requires metadata, such as creation timestamps, last modification timestamps, or explicit validity intervals. Metrics could be inverse age, a decay function score, or a binary flag (Current/Stale).
    *   **Why it's important:** Stale data can be misleading or useless. High timeliness increases the reliability and relevance of the information, especially in dynamic domains (e.g., current employee status, stock prices, sensor readings). Even in static domains (e.g., historical facts), knowing the information is verified recently can be valuable.
    *   **Impact:** Directly impacts the importance of specific **Instance nodes** and **Edge instances (specific triples)**. Nodes/edges representing volatile information require high timeliness to be considered important. For classes/properties, the *average* timeliness of their instances/triples could be a factor.

4.  **Subgraph Importance (Query Frequency) - Utility & Demand (Classes, Instances, Properties):**
    *   **What it measures:** How often are nodes and edges within a specific subgraph (typically rooted at a class node, like "all `Person` instances and their direct properties") accessed or queried by external applications or users? This requires logging and analyzing query patterns.
    *   **Why it's important:** This is a direct measure of *demand* and *utility*. Subgraphs (and the nodes/edges within them) that are frequently queried are demonstrably valuable to the KG's consumers. This helps prioritize resources, caching, and data quality efforts towards parts of the KG that are actively used.
    *   **Impact:** Increases the importance of **Class nodes** (if the class defines a frequently queried subgraph), **Instance nodes** within that subgraph, and **Property edges** frequently used in queries targeting that subgraph.

**Synthesizing Importance:**

No single metric is sufficient. The power comes from combining them. A node/edge might be important because:

*   It belongs to a highly instantiated class (high CIR) and represents timely, frequently queried information (high Timeliness, high Subgraph Importance).
*   It's a property that, while not universally instantiated (moderate PIR), connects critical, timely, and frequently queried entities (high Timeliness & Subgraph Importance for connected nodes).
*   It's an instance in a niche class (low CIR) but represents extremely timely and highly sought-after information (e.g., the current CEO's profile - high Timeliness, high Subgraph Importance when queried).

A final "Importance Score" could be calculated, often as a weighted combination of these normalized metrics. The weights would depend on the specific goals of the KG evaluation (e.g., prioritize usage, prioritize completeness, prioritize timeliness).

`ImportanceScore = w1 * Norm(CIR) + w2 * Norm(PIR) + w3 * Norm(Timeliness) + w4 * Norm(SubgraphImportance)`
*(Note: The application of CIR/PIR needs context - CIR applies to Classes, PIR to Properties. Their scores might influence the scores of related instances/edges).*

**Sample Table and Inference:**

Let's assume we've normalized the metrics to a 0-1 scale (higher is better/more important). CIR applies to Classes, PIR to Properties. For Instances, we might use "Completeness" (based on PIR of filled properties) instead of PIR directly. Timeliness and Subgraph Importance apply more broadly.

| ID          | Type     | Description            | CIR   | PIR / Completeness | Timeliness | Subgraph Importance (Query Freq.) | **Calculated Importance Score (Example)** | **Inferred Importance Rationale**                                                                                                                               |
| :---------- | :------- | :--------------------- | :---- | :----------------- | :--------- | :-------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `:Person`   | Class    | The class of people    | 0.9   | N/A (Avg PIR=0.6)  | N/A        | 0.9                               | High (e.g., 0.85)                       | Core class, highly instantiated, frequently part of queries. Structural backbone and high utility.                                                            |
| `:Company`  | Class    | The class of companies | 0.7   | N/A (Avg PIR=0.7)  | N/A        | 0.8                               | High (e.g., 0.75)                       | Important class, well-instantiated, relevant properties often filled, frequently queried.                                                                     |
| `:Employee` | Class    | Subclass of :Person    | 0.6   | N/A (Avg PIR=0.5)  | N/A        | 0.7                               | Medium-High (e.g., 0.65)                | Significant subclass, but less general than :Person. Still frequently queried in specific contexts (e.g., HR applications).                                    |
| `:SensorX`  | Class    | A type of sensor       | 0.1   | N/A (Avg PIR=0.9)  | N/A        | 0.4                               | Medium (e.g., 0.6)                      | Niche class (low CIR), but its instances have well-defined, consistently filled properties (high Avg PIR). Queries might be infrequent but critical when they occur. |
| `inst:Alice`| Instance | An instance of :Person | N/A   | 0.8 (High)         | 0.9        | 0.9                               | High (e.g., 0.88)                       | Belongs to core class, data is complete & timely, part of frequently queried subgraph. Very important instance.                                                  |
| `inst:Bob`  | Instance | An instance of :Employee| N/A   | 0.5 (Medium)       | 0.4        | 0.7                               | Medium (e.g., 0.55)                     | Belongs to relevant class, but data is less complete/timely. Still part of a reasonably queried subgraph. Moderately important.                                |
| `inst:Sensor123` | Instance | An instance of :SensorX | N/A   | 0.9 (High)         | 1.0        | 0.4                               | Medium-High (e.g., 0.7)                 | Belongs to niche class, but instance data is complete and very timely (critical for sensors). Query frequency for the *class* subgraph is low, but *this specific instance* might be crucial when needed. Importance driven by Timeliness & Completeness. |
| `:worksFor` | Property | Connects :Person/:Company | N/A   | 0.7 (High)         | N/A        | 0.8                               | High (e.g., 0.75)                       | Common relationship (high PIR), connects important classes, frequently used in queries. Very important property.                                              |
| `:hasReading`| Property | Connects :SensorX/:Value | N/A   | 0.9 (Very High)    | N/A        | 0.4                               | Medium (e.g., 0.65)                     | Very common property *for its domain* (high PIR), but domain class is niche. Importance driven by high PIR within its context.                               |
| `:knows`    | Property | Connects :Person/:Person | N/A   | 0.2 (Low)          | N/A        | 0.5                               | Low-Medium (e.g., 0.35)                 | Less common relationship (low PIR), data might be sparse. Queries might exist but are less frequent/central than `:worksFor`. Lower importance property.       |

**Why this Inference Makes Sense:**

1.  **Holistic View:** It considers multiple dimensions – structure (CIR/PIR), data quality/relevance (Timeliness), and actual usage (Subgraph Importance). This avoids over-emphasizing one aspect (like pure connectivity).
2.  **Contextual Importance:** It recognizes that importance isn't absolute. A niche class (`:SensorX`) might be less important overall than a core class (`:Person`), but its instances can be highly important if their data is timely and complete (`inst:Sensor123`). A property's importance (`:hasReading`) depends on its instantiation rate *within its relevant domain*.
3.  **Actionable Insights:** This breakdown helps prioritize KG maintenance and development:
    *   **Low Timeliness on highly queried subgraphs:** Indicates a critical need for data updates.
    *   **Low PIR/Completeness on important classes:** Suggests issues with data ingestion or modeling for those classes.
    *   **High scores across the board:** Identifies the most robust and valuable parts of the KG.
    *   **Low Subgraph Importance despite high CIR/PIR:** Might indicate that a structurally significant part of the KG isn't meeting user needs or isn't well-exposed.
4.  **Reflects Real-World Value:** By incorporating query frequency, the importance score is tied to how the KG is actually *used*, making it a better proxy for real-world value than structure alone.

This combined approach provides a nuanced and comprehensive understanding of node and edge importance, enabling better management, evaluation, and evolution of the Knowledge Graph.

===============================================================
Part 3:

Okay, let's create a sample table illustrating node and edge importance based on our metrics, and then use it to calculate the adapted I-Score.

**Scenario:**

Imagine a small Knowledge Graph about employees, companies, and locations.

*   **Classes:** `:Person`, `:Company`, `:City`
*   **Properties:** `:worksFor` (Person -> Company), `:locatedIn` (Company -> City), `:livesIn` (Person -> City)
*   **Instances:** `Alice` (:Person), `Bob` (:Person), `CorpX` (:Company), `StartupY` (:Company), `Metroville` (:City)
*   **Known Edges:** Alice `:worksFor` CorpX, CorpX `:locatedIn` Metroville, StartupY `:locatedIn` Metroville.
*   **Unknowns (Uncertainty):**
    *   Where does Bob work? (Missing `:worksFor` edge for Bob, implies an unknown `:Company` node or link to existing). Let's assume it's a missing edge (`un:Edge1`) to an unknown company (`un:Node1`).
    *   Where does Alice live? (Missing `:livesIn` edge for Alice, implies unknown `:City` node or link). Let's assume it's a missing edge (`un:Edge2`) to an unknown city (`un:Node2`).
    *   Where does Bob live? (Missing `:livesIn` edge for Bob). Missing edge (`un:Edge3`), potentially to Metroville or the unknown city (`un:Node2`).

**Assumptions for Metrics (Normalized 0-1, Higher = Better/More):**

*   **CIR:** `:Person`=0.8, `:Company`=0.6, `:City`=0.3
*   **PIR:** `:worksFor`=0.7, `:locatedIn`=0.9, `:livesIn`=0.4
*   **Timeliness:** Varies per instance/edge (see table). Assume average timeliness for classes/properties where needed for unknowns (e.g., AvgTime(:Company)=0.8, AvgTime(:City)=0.5, AvgTime(:worksFor)=0.7, AvgTime(:livesIn)=0.6).
*   **Subgraph Importance (Query Freq):** `:Person` related=0.9, `:Company` related=0.8, `:City` related=0.5. `:worksFor` queries=0.85, `:locatedIn` queries=0.7, `:livesIn` queries=0.4.
*   **Importance Score (`Imp`) Calculation:** For simplicity, we'll assign a plausible `Imp` score based on the contributing factors rather than using explicit weights, focusing on the *rationale*.

**Calculating the Adapted I-Score:**

1.  **Identify Unknowns:**
    *   Unknown Nodes (`Sn`): `un:Node1`, `un:Node2`. So, `|Sn| = 2`.
    *   Unknown Edges (`Se`): `un:Edge1`, `un:Edge2`, `un:Edge3`. So, `|Se| = 3`.

2.  **Get Importance Scores for Unknowns from Table:**
    *   `Imp(un:Node1)` = 0.75
    *   `Imp(un:Node2)` = 0.50
    *   `Imp(un:Edge1)` = 0.80
    *   `Imp(un:Edge2)` = 0.55
    *   `Imp(un:Edge3)` = 0.50

3.  **Calculate Average Importance of Unknowns:**
    *   `Avg(Imp_unknown_nodes)` = (0.75 + 0.50) / 2 = 0.625
    *   `Avg(Imp_unknown_edges)` = (0.80 + 0.55 + 0.50) / 3 = 1.85 / 3 ≈ 0.617

4.  **Calculate Log Terms (using base 2):**
    *   `log2(|Sn|)` = log2(2) = 1
    *   `log2(|Se|)` = log2(3) ≈ 1.585

5.  **Calculate Adapted I-Score (assuming uniform probability for simplicity):**
    *   `I_Score_adapted` = `log2(|Sn|) * Avg(Imp_unknown_nodes) + log2(|Se|) * Avg(Imp_unknown_edges)`
    *   `I_Score_adapted` = (1 * 0.625) + (1.585 * 0.617)
    *   `I_Score_adapted` = 0.625 + 0.978
    *   `I_Score_adapted` ≈ **1.603**

**Reasoning and Interpretation:**

*   The table shows how different entities and relationships have varying importance based on a combination of structural relevance (CIR/PIR), data quality (Timeliness), and utility (Subgraph Importance). `:Person` and `:worksFor` are highly important, while `:City` and `:livesIn` are less so. Instance importance (`Alice`, `Bob`) is high due to their class and timeliness.
*   The **importance scores for unknown items are crucial**. We estimate `un:Node1` (Bob's company) and `un:Edge1` (Bob's `:worksFor` link) as highly important because they involve important entities/relationships (`Bob`, `:Company`, `:worksFor`) that are frequently queried and expected to be populated. Conversely, `un:Node2` (Alice's city) and `un:Edge2`/`un:Edge3` (the `:livesIn` links) are estimated as less important due to the lower importance of the `:City` class and `:livesIn` property.
*   The **Adapted I-Score of ~1.603** reflects the total uncertainty (`log` terms quantify the amount of missing information) weighted by the *average estimated importance* of that missing information.
*   **Contrast:** If we used the original I-Score approach from the paper with `cn = ce = 0.5`, the calculation would be: `(1 * 0.5) + (1.585 * 0.5) = 0.5 + 0.7925 = 1.2925`. The adapted score (1.603) is higher because the average importance of the unknowns (Nodes: 0.625, Edges: 0.617) is greater than the flat 0.5 assumed in the simpler model. This indicates that the missing information, on average, is considered *more important* than the baseline assumption, driven particularly by the high importance of finding Bob's employer.

This table and calculation demonstrate how incorporating nuanced importance metrics provides a more informative measure of uncertainty, highlighting not just *how much* is unknown, but *how much value* is potentially missing from the KG.
