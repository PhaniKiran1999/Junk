Okay, here are a few options for a clearer, more concise, and cohesive abstract, ranging from slightly revised to significantly condensed.

**Option 1 (Moderate Revision - Maintains most detail but improves flow):**

> Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are fundamental in edge-intelligent systems, like Personalized Data Engines, for capturing user behavior and enabling semantic reasoning. However, the limited resources of edge devices and dynamic user interactions demand continuous KG evaluation to ensure efficiency and relevance. To address this, we introduce a comprehensive framework for evaluating KGs throughout their lifecycleâ€”construction, utilization, expansion, and pruning. Central to our framework is the Personalized Relevance-weighted Information Score Metric (PRISM), which enhances traditional metrics by incorporating personalization and relevance. PRISM quantifies knowledge value and uncertainty by assessing multi-faceted node/edge importance (structural, temporal, usage). Validated on real-world KGs, our approach effectively optimizes KGs for edge-based applications. The framework identifies redundant or underutilized components and guides targeted interventions, improving KG efficiency and adaptability in resource-constrained environments. This work provides a robust methodology for continuous KG evaluation and improvement, aligning KGs with evolving user needs.

**Option 2 (More Concise - Focuses on the core contribution):**

> Edge-intelligent systems rely on Knowledge Graphs (KGs), but device constraints and dynamic user interactions necessitate continuous evaluation for efficiency and relevance. We propose a comprehensive framework for KG evaluation across its lifecycle, centered on the Personalized Relevance-weighted Information Score Metric (PRISM). PRISM enhances traditional scores by incorporating personalization and relevance, quantifying knowledge value and uncertainty based on multi-faceted node/edge importance (structural, temporal, usage). Our validated approach optimizes KGs for resource-constrained edge environments by identifying inefficiencies and guiding targeted improvements. This framework provides a robust methodology for continuous KG enhancement, ensuring better alignment with user needs.

**Option 3 (Most Concise - High-level summary):**

> Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are vital for edge-intelligent systems but require continuous evaluation due to device limitations and dynamic user needs. We introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework featuring the Personalized Relevance-weighted Information Score Metric (PRISM). PRISM assesses KG relevance and value by incorporating personalization and multi-dimensional importance factors. Validated on real-world data, our framework optimizes KGs for resource-constrained edge environments by identifying underutilized components and guiding efficiency improvements. This offers a robust methodology for aligning KGs with evolving user requirements in edge systems.
